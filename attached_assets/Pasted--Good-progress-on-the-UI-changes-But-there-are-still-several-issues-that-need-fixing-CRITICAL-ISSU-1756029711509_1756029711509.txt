"Good progress on the UI changes! But there are still several issues that need fixing:
CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:

Timer Position Problem:

The timer is now positioned in front of the blackboard and blocking the view
FIX: Move the timer to top-right corner or another clear area away from gameplay elements


Difficulty Levels Not Working:

All difficulty levels feel exactly the same - no difference between Rookie/Veteran/Substitute/Principal
IMPLEMENT REAL DIFFERENCES:
javascript// Rookie Teacher (Easy)
teacher.speed = 1.0;
teacher.detectionRange = 60;
teacher.patrolDelay = 3000ms;

// Veteran Teacher (Medium) 
teacher.speed = 1.5;
teacher.detectionRange = 80;
teacher.patrolDelay = 2000ms;

// Substitute Teacher (Hard)
teacher.speed = 2.0;
teacher.detectionRange = 100;
teacher.patrolDelay = 1000ms;

// Principal (Expert)
teacher.speed = 2.5;
teacher.detectionRange = 120;
teacher.patrolDelay = 500ms;



Mission System Still Too Simple:

Missions are still just "click E" from anywhere
MAKE STRATEGIC: Student must be physically near objects:

Clock Hack: Within 50 pixels of wall clock
Chalk Drop: Within 50 pixels of blackboard
Fake Bell: Within 50 pixels of intercom
Paper Airplane: Within 50 pixels of any desk


Add visual feedback when student is close enough (highlight the object)


Game Start Bug:

When changing difficulty, it shows "teacher caught you" instead of starting the level
FIX: Reset game state properly when difficulty changes:
javascriptfunction startNewGame() {
    confusionMeter = 0;
    stealthMeter = 100;
    gameTime = 0;
    gameState = 'playing';
    // Reset student and teacher positions
}



ADD PUNISHMENT MECHANIC (VERY IMPORTANT):

When student gets caught (stealth decreases), confusion meter should ALSO decrease
Scale the punishment by difficulty level:
javascriptfunction onStudentCaught() {
    // Stealth penalty
    stealthMeter -= stealthPenalty;
    
    // Confusion penalty (increases with difficulty)
    const confusionPenalty = {
        0: 5,   // Rookie: -5 confusion when caught
        1: 10,  // Veteran: -10 confusion when caught  
        2: 15,  // Substitute: -15 confusion when caught
        3: 20   // Principal: -20 confusion when caught
    };
    
    confusionMeter = Math.max(0, confusionMeter - confusionPenalty[currentDifficulty]);
    
    // Visual feedback
    showFloatingText("CAUGHT! -" + confusionPenalty[currentDifficulty] + " CONFUSION!", "red");
}




POSITIONING FIXES NEEDED:

Timer: Move to top-right corner
Game buttons: Keep in corner but make sure they don't overlap gameplay
Mission prompts: Show "Press E" only when near valid objects

This punishment system makes higher difficulties much more challenging because getting caught not only hurts stealth but also sets back your progress toward the 100% confusion goal!"
