"I've uploaded a ZIP file containing the Class Time Hacker retro arcade game that needs to be fully fixed and completed. This is a browser-based HTML5 Canvas game where you play as a student trying to hack your way out of class early.
CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:

Title Screen Layout - The title text "CLASS TIME HACKER" is positioned too far right, need to center it properly on screen
Timer System Broken - The 2-minute countdown timer is not working/updating at all
Missing Core Gameplay - Student and teacher sprites are not rendering or functioning:

Student character should be visible and controllable with arrow keys
Teacher should patrol the classroom with AI detection system
No sprites are currently showing up on the canvas


Game Loop Issues - The requestAnimationFrame loop may not be running properly

GAME CONCEPT (WHAT IT SHOULD BE):

Objective: Fill Confusion Meter to 100% while keeping Stealth above 0% within 2 minutes
Player: Student character (32x32 pixels) with blue uniform, brown hair, backpack
Enemy: Teacher character (32x32 pixels) with professional attire, glasses, patrol routes
Setting: Classroom with desks, blackboard, wall clock, intercom system

CORE MECHANICS TO IMPLEMENT:

Student Character:

Controllable with arrow keys (WASD alternative)
Walking animation with 4-frame cycle
Can hide behind desks to avoid detection
Sneaking posture when hiding


Teacher AI:

Patrols between 4 classroom points in cycles
Has line-of-sight detection system
Multiple emotional states: normal, confused, angry, freakout
Different difficulty levels change patrol speed and detection


Mission System (4 types):

Clock Hack: Interact with wall clock, causes time display glitches
Chalk Drop: Near blackboard, creates dust particle effects
Fake Bell: At intercom, triggers false class dismissal
Paper Airplane: From any desk, distracts teacher


Visual Systems:

Particle effects for all actions (sparks, dust, paper trails)
Floating text for feedback (+CONFUSION!, CAUGHT!, etc.)
Comedy animations for teacher freakouts
Dynamic blackboard text changes



TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

60fps smooth gameplay using requestAnimationFrame
Proper collision detection for missions and hiding spots
Working UI meters (Confusion: green bar, Stealth: red bar)
Mobile-responsive virtual controls
CRT-style visual effects with scanlines

DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION:

Rookie Teacher (slow, predictable)
Veteran Teacher (faster, smarter)
Substitute Teacher (paranoid, random)
Principal (multiple enemies, security cameras)

PLEASE:

Examine the uploaded files and understand the intended game structure
Fix all rendering issues - make sprites visible and animated
Implement the complete game loop with working timer
Center the title screen properly
Test all 4 mission types work with cooldowns and risk/reward
Ensure teacher AI patrols and detects player properly
Add particle effects and floating text feedback
Make it a complete, playable arcade experience

The game should feel like a polished retro arcade game with personality, humor, and strategic depth. Every character should look like actual people (not geometric shapes) with detailed pixel art sprites and smooth animations.
EXPECTED RESULT: A fully functional 2-minute arcade experience where players strategically use multiple tools to create classroom chaos while avoiding detection!"
